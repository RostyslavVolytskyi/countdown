### Problem
Build a countdown timer with controls to add time, speed up / slow down the countdown, pause and resume.

### Requirements
* The user should be able to enter a # of minutes (positive integer) and click a “Start” button to initialize the countdown.
* Timer format: MM:SS
* The user should be able to pause & resume the countdown using pause/resume
buttons.
* While the countdown timer is active, the user should be able to speed up / slow
down the speed at the following rates: -- 1.0X (normal speed, selected by
default) -- 1.5X -- 2X
* When half of the selected duration has been passed, display a string of text
above the countdown timer reading: “More than halfway there!”
* When the countdown timer reaches 0, this text should change to: “Time’s up!” • When the countdown is within 20 seconds of ending, the countdown timer text
should turn red.
* At 10 seconds, the text should start blinking.
* Include unit testing for applicable functionality.
* The countdown timer functionality should be appropriately divided into well-
defined components.
* The look of the countdown timer should have a production-ready clean/modern
aesthetic. Feel free to creatively stylize the elements.
* Extra credit: Play a sound as the timer ends.
* Export as a git repository (either as a .zip file or a link to a public repository) with
screenshots in the README.md file.
